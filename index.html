        The Chicano Movement was a social movement in the early 1960s. After the Mexican-American war, workers were promised better wages and work conditions, however, they faced discrimination, racism, and segregation instead. During this time, many Chicano activists embraced their background and took pride in their ancient ancestry. We will be translating 3 popular songs developed during the Chicano Movement for our translation project. Activists wrote songs in order to unite the Chicanos across America to fight for equal rights, voting rights, and educational rights. As a result, the music separated the Chicano identity from both Mexican and American identities, empowering Chicano culture, and linking farmers and activists to create the United Farm Workers of America. 
	      <p style= "text-indent: 40px">The song “Yo Soy Chicano,” by Los Alvarados happens to be one of the most popular songs from the movement. The lyrics and melody were able to connect the Chicano people through ethnic pride and Mexican tradition. Juanita Dominguez, author of the song, wrote the lyrics in 1968 while on her way to Washington D.C. to march for the Poor People’s Campaign. Dominguez wrote the melody in inspiration by another revolutionary song, “La Rielera,” which was from the Mexican Revolution. Dominguez did this with the intention of keeping the revolutionary spirit of the past, in addition to adding lyrics that address economic and racial issues Mexican-Americans were currently facing. Although written by Dominguez, the song was sung and recorded by the band Los Alvarados in 1973. The band consists of the three members Manuel, Ramon, and Emiliao Alvarado. The song was recorded for the album, El Movimiento Chicano and was eventually put on the album Rolas de Aztlan: Songs of the Chicano Movement.  
        <p style= "text-indent: 40px">In the 1960s, Mexican farm workers wanted civil equality and social justice and sought a method to express their cause, one of wanting equality, to other farm workers and people that are uneducated about their cause. As a result, El Teatro Campesino was formed. It is a company founded by Luis Valdez as part of the United Farm Workers Union in 1965 by and for farm workers. The company would create, practice, and perform acts to share their cause. Valdez created short plays to educate other farm workers and rally support while unifying the union. “El Picket Sign” is one song written by Valdez to inform farm workers that continued working during a strike about the inequalities they faced, effectively accomplishing their goal. Another song El Teatro Campesino took part in was “Yo No Le Tengo Miedo A Nada” which portrayed the farm workers’ undying spirit. Today, El Teatro Campesino is still an organization that creates and performs theatrical productions that reflect their history, their experiences, and their identity.

    Yo no le tengo miedo a nada, a nada le tengo miedo yo. Unos pierden y otros ganan, pero a mí no me gusta perder. <br>
    Y por eso les digo a mis amigos que se paren ya de vender, porque aquel que es vendido siempre le va de perder. <br>
    Mira, mira, mira, mira Mira, mira como corren. Parece que si paran el trabajo perderá. Que no saben esquiroles, que ya la llevan de perder. <br>
    Corran, corran esquiroles, y no dejen de correr. Que muy cerca los huelguistas ya los van a convencer <br>
    Yo no le tengo miedo a nada, a nada le tengo miedo yo. Unos pierden y otros ganan, pero a mí no me gusta perder.

    I am not scared of anything, I fear nothing. Some lose and others win, but I don't like to lose <br>
    That's why I tell my friends to not be a sell-out because the one who is a sellout always ends up losing. <br>
    Look, look, look, look, look, look how they run. It seems that if the strikers stop, they will lose their jobs. What the strikebreakers don't know is that they'll lose their jobs anyway. <br>
    Run, run, and don't stop running, strikebreakers. Soon enough the strikers are going to convince you <br>
    I am not scared of anything. I fear nothing. Some lose and others win, but I don't like to lose.

      Desde Tejas a California Campesinos están luchando. ¡Los rancheros a llore y llore de huelga ya están bien pandos! <br>

      El picket sign, el picket sign, lo llevo por todo el día. El picket sign, el picket sign, conmigo toda la vida <br>
      Un primo que tengo yo Andaba regando ditches. Un día con Pagarulo, otro con Zanavaviches. <br>
      El picket sign, el picket sign, lo llevo por todo el día. El picket sign, el picket sign, conmigo toda la vida <br>
      Me dicen que soy muy necio, gritón y alborota pueblos. Pero Juárez fue mi tío, y Zapata fue mi suegro. <br>
      El picket sign, el picket sign, lo llevo por todo el día. El picket sign, el picket sign, conmigo toda la vida <br>
      Y ahora ando organizando La raza en todos los files. y muchos siguen comiendo Tortillas con puros chiles. <br>

      From Texas to California, farm workers are fighting. The ranchers cry and cry from the strike they're already slow and weak! <br>
      The picket sign, the picket sign,  I carry it all day. The picket sign, the picket sign, is with me all my life <br>
      We have been fighting with this strike for more than a year. One rancher has died and another has become a grandmother. <br>
      The picket sign, the picket sign,  I carry it all day. The picket sign, the picket sign, is with me all my life <br>
      I have a cousin who watered ditches. One day with Pagarulo, another with Zanavaviches.
      The picket sign, the picket sign,  I carry it all day. The picket sign, the picket sign, is with me all my life <br>
      They tell me I am very stubborn, shout too much and incite people. But Juarez was my uncle and Zapata was my father-in law. <br>
      The picket sign, the picket sign,  I carry it all day. The picket sign, the picket sign, is with me all my life <br>
      And now I am organizing people in the fields while many continue to eat tortillas with only chilies. <br>
      The picket sign, the picket sign,  I carry it all day. The picket sign, the picket sign, is with me all my life <br>
      There are many that don't understand, even though one gives them advice. The strike is good for everybody, but some are made cowardly. <br>
      The picket sign, the picket sign,  I carry it all day. The picket sign, the picket sign, is with me all my life <br>
